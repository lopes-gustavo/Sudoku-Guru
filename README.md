# Sudoku Guru

I love solving Sudoku. Sometimes, I like to solve extreme hard ones. 
The problem is that often, I find myself in a place where I don't know the next cell to solve
and the tips only give you the number, instead of explaining why it was like that.

This project solves that. It's a sudoku teacher.
