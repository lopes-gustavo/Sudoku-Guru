# Sudoku Guru

I love solving Sudoku. Sometimes, I like to solve extremely hard ones. 
The problem is, more often than I'd like to admit, I find myself in a place where I don't know the next cell to solve.
And the tips only give you the result, not the explaination why it was like that.

This project solves that. It's a sudoku teacher.
